  # choc spread is just a LITTLE too tight for me,
  # so bump it up by 1mm
  # This is by coincidence the same as "u" but "cx + 1"
  # expresses the intent more clearly
  $default_spread: cx + 1
  # I definitely want minimal vertical padding though
  # so "cy" here is choc y
  $default_padding: cy
  # "proxy" width and height variables
